# Quantum Chronicles - My Quantum Computing Journey
My growing portfolio of quantum computing solutions, notes, and experiments in the quantum realm, starting with qiskit events, exercises and beyond.

Welcome to **Quantum Chronicles**  
This is where I keep my **solutions, notes, and experiments** from various quantum computing courses and events.  
It’s like my learning diary as I explore the world of quantum computing.

This repo has my work from:
- **IBM Quantum Explorer 2023** – My solutions to the challenges and exercises from the IBM Quantum Explorer 2023 event.
- **Qiskit Global Summer School 2024** – Weekly assignments and projects I solved in the Qiskit Global Summer School 2024.
- **Qiskit Global Summer School 2025** – My latest solutions and experiments from the Qiskit Global Summer School 2025.

And much more to come... as I’ll keep adding more of my work.

## Folder List
